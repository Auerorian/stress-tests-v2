# stress-tests-v2
This is a re-make of Jacob Kaulike's stress-scripts which is not in a public repo :)

The Intent is to have a maintained app in "pre-shipped" ISOs for Pop_OS! for the System76 Build team and RMA team. This app is for stress-testing systems and providing the customer with a finished file showing the results. For the Build team, we want an interactive application to replace the original terminal windows. 

MOST COMMITS WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL I HAVE MORE DONE! THEN THIS WILL BE REMOVED

We would also like to replace some current methods of testing with our own. Like replacing Unigine superposition with something more open source for AMD systems. Or just creating my own.

I am considering making items like GPU-Burn pre-compiled. Not sure yet. Intel/AMD dev-id's, would need to be added with new releases
