# stress-tests-v2
This is a "re-make"of Jacob Kaulike's stress-scripts which is not public :)

The Intent is to have a maintained app to "ship" with Pop_OS! installs (pre-shipped) for System76 Build team. This app is for stress-testing systems and providing the customer with a finished file showing the results. For build team, we want an interactive application to replace the original terminal windows. 

We would also like to replace some current methods of testing with our own. Like replacing Unigine super position with something open source for AMD systems.

A good portion of the code used here will probably be a mash up of the original code. For example, "sudomodule.py" was written by Jacob Kaulike. I would like to give credit where due as I am dumb as shit. :)

Everything should be pre-built and maintained on a at minimum, weekly basis. For example, updating gpu-burn, python modules, intel/amd dev-id's, and so on.
